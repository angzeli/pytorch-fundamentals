# 📘 From PyTorch to Bayesian Optimisation

This repository is a concept-first exploration of gradients, automatic differentiation, optimisation, and surrogate-based decision-making using PyTorch.

Rather than teaching PyTorch only as a high-level deep-learning framework, the material uses it as a numerical and analytical tool for understanding a much broader progression:

- tensors and linear algebra,
- computation graphs and automatic differentiation,
- gradient structure and optimisation dynamics,
- modelling unknown objective functions,
- uncertainty-aware surrogate models,
- and finally **Bayesian Optimisation** through BoTorch.

The goal is not just to show how to compute gradients or train models, but to build a coherent path from **low-level PyTorch mechanics** to **modern data-efficient optimisation**.

In other words, this repository is designed as a bridge:

> **from PyTorch fundamentals to Bayesian Optimisation.**

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most tutorials either:
- stop at PyTorch basics,
- jump quickly into neural-network training,
- or treat Bayesian Optimisation as a separate black-box topic.

This repository takes a different route.

It deliberately slows down and builds the ideas in sequence.

PyTorch is treated not just as a framework for fitting models, but as a flexible environment for understanding:
- gradients as mathematical objects,
- autograd as a computational mechanism,
- optimisation as a dynamical process,
- and surrogate modelling as a way to reason about expensive unknown functions.

By the time Bayesian Optimisation is introduced, it should feel like the natural outcome of ideas already developed:
- first understand gradients,
- then understand optimisation,
- then understand why optimisation alone is not enough,
- then build models of unknown functions,
- and finally use those models to guide intelligent search.

The aim is therefore not just to teach isolated tools, but to build a conceptual pathway:

> **PyTorch → gradients → optimisation → surrogate modelling → Bayesian Optimisation**

Each notebook is self-contained and can be read independently, but the intended experience is sequential.

🌱 The repository is still growing.

## 📘 Part 1 — Foundations: Tensors, Autograd, and Gradient Structure

Part 1 builds the conceptual foundations needed to understand gradients before optimisation algorithms are introduced.

It covers:
- tensor mechanics and numerical structure,
- how autograd builds and traverses computation graphs,
- scalar vs tensor-valued differentiation,
- vector–Jacobian products as the core object of `backward`,
- interpreting `.grad` as sensitivity,
- and visualising gradient structure in controlled experiments.

Part 1 concludes with two workshops that explicitly connect gradient structure to **local optimisation intuition**, without yet introducing optimisers or training pipelines.

📂 See `part_1/README.md` for full details.

## 📘 Part 2 — Optimisation Dynamics 

Part 2 builds directly on the gradient intuition developed in Part 1 and studies how optimisation behaviour emerges over time.

It covers:
- gradient descent as a discrete dynamical system,
- learning rates, stability, and contraction,
- geometry, conditioning, and narrow valleys,
- momentum and inertia,
- and the challenges of optimisation beyond convexity.


📂 See `part_2/README.md` for full details.

## 📘 Part 3 — Modelling Unknown Functions and Bayesian Optimisation Foundations

Part 3 is the conceptual bridge from optimisation dynamics to **Bayesian Optimisation**.

We now study what happens when the objective function is:
- expensive to evaluate,
- only partially observed,
- and better handled through a learned surrogate than through brute-force search.

This part develops the core ideas needed before using modern Bayesian Optimisation libraries.

It introduces:
- why expensive objectives require modelling,
- how surrogate models approximate unknown functions,
- why prediction alone is not enough without uncertainty,
- Gaussian Processes as principled probabilistic surrogates,
- and acquisition functions for deciding where to evaluate next.

This prepares the ground for the next stage of the repository, where these ideas are implemented more practically using **BoTorch**.

## 🧪 Fresh vs Worked Notebooks

For most notebooks, two versions exist:
- "Fresh": clean, minimal versions intended for reading, teaching, or first-pass study.
  The "Fresh" notebooks are in the main folder.
  
- Worked: exploratory versions containing additional experiments, plots, and intermediate outputs. Models answers are also in these notebooks.
  The worked notebooks are in `worked/` folder.

This separation keeps the main narrative clear while preserving the full reasoning process.

## 🎯 Intended Audience

This repository is suitable for:
- advanced undergraduates,
- master’s students,
- PhD students,
- or practitioners who want a deeper understanding of gradients and optimisation.

A background in linear algebra and basic calculus is assumed, but no prior deep-learning experience is required.
