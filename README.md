# PyTorch Fundamentals

This repository contains a growing set of notes and notebooks exploring core PyTorch concepts.  
It currently starts with an introductory notebook on **PyTorch tensor fundamentals** 📐.

The emphasis is on building **clear intuition** and **good habits** when working with PyTorch, rather than providing a comprehensive API reference.

## 🎯 Scope and Intent

These materials are written as **learning and teaching notes**, intended to clarify how PyTorch tensors behave in practice.

Topics such as automatic differentiation (autograd), neural network modules, and optimisation routines are **not covered in the current notebook**, but may be introduced in future notebooks.

---

## 🧩 Recommended Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy arrays

---

## ▶️ How to Use

Each notebook is self-contained and can be read independently.  
Examples are designed to be minimal, explicit, and easy to experiment with.

The notebooks in `/notebooks/` are the clean, recommended versions.  
Worked and exploratory versions are archived in `/notebooks/worked/`.

PDF exports of each notebook are available in `/exports`.

---

## 📦 Versions and Legacy Files

Each tutorial notebook is versioned (e.g. `v1.0`, `v1.1`) to reflect meaningful updates and improvements.

- The **latest version** of each tutorial is kept in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Earlier versions are preserved in the `notebooks/legacy/` folder for reference and comparison. This is the same for `exports`.

Readers are encouraged to start with the most recent version unless they have a specific reason to consult an older release.
