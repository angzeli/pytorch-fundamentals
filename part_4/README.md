# 📘 Part 4 — Practical Bayesian Optimisation Workflows in BoTorch

Part 4 takes the conceptual foundations of Part 3 and turns them into **practical Bayesian Optimisation workflows in BoTorch**.

In Part 3, the emphasis was on understanding *why* Bayesian Optimisation needs surrogate models, uncertainty, and acquisition functions.  
In Part 4, those ideas are implemented directly in a modern BO library.

We now study what happens when Bayesian Optimisation is treated not only as a conceptual framework, but as a **working computational workflow**:

- Gaussian Process surrogates are fit in BoTorch,
- acquisition functions are instantiated and optimised numerically,
- full sequential BO loops are built explicitly,
- and practical modelling choices are tested in settings where they visibly affect behaviour.

This part introduces the core implementation habits needed before more advanced BO settings can be understood:

- how BoTorch represents GP surrogates,
- how standard acquisition functions are evaluated and optimised,
- how a reusable BO loop is constructed,
- why minimisation problems are often recast in maximisation form,
- and how practical choices such as transforms, noise level, acquisition-optimisation settings, and initial design affect BO outcomes.

The goal is not just to learn *how to call BoTorch functions*, but to understand **how standard Bayesian Optimisation behaves once implemented in practice**.

## 🎯 Scope and Philosophy

Across these tutorials, BoTorch workflows are treated as:

- implementations of model-guided decision-making, not just API usage,
- numerical optimisation pipelines, not just mathematical abstractions,
- and practical tools whose behaviour depends strongly on modelling choices.

The material emphasises:

- the translation from Bayesian Optimisation concepts to BoTorch objects,
- the role of standard acquisition functions in decision-making,
- the construction of full sequential BO loops,
- the distinction between the true objective and the surrogate’s current belief,
- and the practical importance of scaling, noise, acquisition optimisation, and initial design.

By the end of Part 4, you should be comfortable answering questions like:

- *How do I implement and visualise standard acquisition functions in BoTorch?*
- *How does a full sequential BO loop look in code?*
- *Why can two BO runs with the same objective behave differently?*
- *What practical defaults usually make BoTorch BO behave better?*
- *Why does stronger acquisition optimisation not always imply better overall BO performance?*

## 🧠 How Part 4 Fits into the Series

Part 4 is **implementation-focused and workflow-oriented**.

It marks the point where the ideas of surrogate modelling, uncertainty, and acquisition-driven search are no longer treated only conceptually.  
Instead, they become explicit BoTorch workflows that can be run, inspected, and modified.

So the series now shifts:

- from the conceptual foundations of Bayesian Optimisation,
- to practical implementation and behaviour in a modern BO library.

This part intentionally stays within **standard single-loop Bayesian Optimisation** so that the behaviour of the workflow remains interpretable.

**Part 5** will extend these ideas further into more realistic and advanced settings, including:

- higher-dimensional experimental BO,
- batch BO for parallel experimentation,
- mixed-variable and constrained BO,
- and budget-aware or human-in-the-loop BO workflows.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Completion of **Part 3**
- Basic familiarity with Gaussian Processes and acquisition functions
- Some comfort with PyTorch tensors and plotting
- Curiosity about *how Bayesian Optimisation ideas become real computational workflows in BoTorch*
