    "# 📘 Tutorial 2: A Minimal Learning Problem and First Contact with Autograd\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial builds on the tensor fundamentals introduced in Tutorial 1 and provdies the **first concrete encounter with learning and optimisation** in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than starting with large models or complex architectures, the tutorials focuses on a **deliberately minimal learning problem**, allowing every component of the training process to be examined in isolation and understood mechanistically.\n",

    "---\n",
    "**The tutorial is designed to shift perspective**:\n",

    "- from *\"tensors as static numerical objects\"*\n",
    "- to *\"tensors as quantities connected by a computation graph\"*\n",

    "- basic tensor operations (Tutorial 1),\n",
    "- to computation graphs and gradient flow (Tutorial 3),\n",
    "- and prepares the ground for understanding gradients beyond scalar losses (Tutorial 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "While optimisation appears here for the first time, it is introduced in its **simplest possible form**, so that later discussions of gradient structure, sensitivity, and objective design have a clear reference point.\n",

    "### Why gradients must be cleared\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, PyTorch **accumulates gradients**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Calling `backward()` multiple times without resetting gradients will **add new gradients** to the existing values stored in `.grad`\n",
    "- This behaviour is intentional and allows gradients to be accumulated across multiple backward passes (e.g. when summing losses)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most training loops—especially when learning—this accumulation can be confusing and lead to subtle bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearing gradients explicitly ensures that each backward pass computes gradients **only for the current forward computation**."

    "The object `<AddBackward0>` represents the backward rule for the addition operation that produced `z`.\n",
