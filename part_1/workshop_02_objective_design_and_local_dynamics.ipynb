    "- how objective structure influences optimisation trajectories,\n",
    "- and how gradient geometry affects stability, speed, and convergence.\n",

    "- conditioning and anisotropy in gradient-driven updates,\n",
    "- how symmetry, nonlinearity, and curvature shape optimisation paths,\n",
    "- and visualising optimisation as movement through parameter space.\n",

    "- and more advanced optimisation topics such as learning rates, curvature, and second-order effects (later in Part 2).\n",

    "## 🧩 Problem: Designing an Objective via Upstream Gradients\n",

    "> Optimisation is not only about how to minimise a loss\n",
    "> — it is also about what objective you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implicitly define an objective by choosing an upstream gradient.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "Y = torch.tanh(X @ X.T)\n",

    "1. Construct an upstream gradient matrix V such that:\n",
    "    - diagonal entries of Y are emphasised,\n",
    "    - off-diagonal entries are penalised.\n",
    "2. Call:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "3. Inspect `X.grad`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to think about\n",
    "- What implicit scalar objective are you optimising?\n",
    "- How does changing the diagonal/off-diagonal weighting affect `X.grad`?\n",
    "- Which entries of `X` are encouraged to grow or shrink?\n",
    "- Can you interpret this as encouraging **self-similarity** over **cross-similarity**?\n",

    "- structure-aware optimisation,\n",
    "- gradients as *design tools*, not just training signals.\n",
