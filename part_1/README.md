# 📘 Part 1 — PyTorch Foundations: Tensors, Autograd, and Gradient Structure

Part 1 introduces the conceptual foundations needed to understand **how tensors are manipulated, how gradients are constructed, how they propagate through computation graphs, and how they should be interpreted in PyTorch** before any optimisation algorithms are introduced.

Rather than focusing on training pipelines or neural network abstractions, this part treats PyTorch as a **numerical and analytical framework** for studying tensor structure, automatic differentiation, and gradient flow.

The aim is not only to learn *how* to compute gradients, but to understand **what they mean, where they come from, and why they take the form they do**.

## 🎯 Scope and Philosophy

Across these tutorials, gradients are treated as:

- mathematical objects, not black-box signals,
- sensitivity measures, not just optimisation updates,
- structured quantities shaped by both computation graphs and chosen objectives.

The material emphasises:

- explicit reasoning about tensor shape and tensor operations,
- computation graphs as the mechanism underlying `autograd`,
- scalar and tensor-valued differentiation,
- vector–Jacobian products as the core object computed by `backward(v)`,
- and interpreting `.grad` geometrically, structurally, and analytically.

By the end of Part 1, you should be comfortable answering questions such as:

- *What exactly does `.backward()` compute?*
- *Why are tensor shape and dimensionality so important in PyTorch?*
- *How do computation graphs determine gradient flow?*
- *Why does a gradient look the way it does?*
- *What changes when the output is not a scalar?*

## 🧠 How Part 1 Fits into the Series

Part 1 is **conceptual, structural, and diagnostic**.

It deliberately avoids:

- optimisers,
- full training pipelines,
- datasets,
- and neural network modules as the main focus.

Instead, it builds a mental model of PyTorch in layers:

1. tensors as structured mathematical objects,
2. tensor operations as the practical language of computation,
3. gradients as derivatives of tracked computations,
4. computation graphs as the mechanism behind backpropagation,
5. and vector–Jacobian products as the correct framework for non-scalar differentiation.

This is what makes later topics — such as gradient descent, optimisation dynamics, curvature, and objective design — feel **motivated rather than mysterious**.

**Part 2** will build on this by taking gradients as already-understood objects and asking what happens when we use them repeatedly to drive optimisation.
