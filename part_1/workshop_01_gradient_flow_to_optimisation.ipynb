    "This set of workshops builds on Tutorials 1–4 and closes **Part 1** of the series, consolidating core ideas about PyTorch `autograd` and gradient flow before moving on to explicit optimisation in and Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating gradients as black-box training signals, the workshop emphasises **gradients as sensitivity measures**, especially in settings where model outputs are **tensor-valued** and gradients are computed using **explicit upstream directions**.\n",

    "**The emphasis is on developing intuition for**:\n",
    "- how gradients flow through structured linear and nonlinear computations,\n",
    "- how upstream gradients select directions in output space,\n",
    "- how `.grad` reflects sensitivity rather than optimisation,\n",
    "- and how gradient structure anticipates optimisation behaviour.\n",

    "- vector–Jacobian products as the fundamental object computed by `backward(v)`,\n",
    "- the role of upstream gradients in shaping gradient flow,\n",
    "- sparsity and structure in gradients induced by linear maps and nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU),\n",
    "- interpreting gradients statistically and geometrically rather than procedurally,\n",

    "- and **objective design and optimisation dynamics** (Workshop 2 and Part 2).\n",
