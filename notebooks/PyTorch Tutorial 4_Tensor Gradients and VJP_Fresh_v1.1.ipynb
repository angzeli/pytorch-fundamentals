    "# Scope of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on earlier tutorials and focuses on understanding how PyTorch handles **gradients when the output of a computation is a tensor rather than a scalar.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, it introduces **vector–Jacobian products** (VJPs) as the fundamental object computed by `autograd` when calling `backward()` on **non-scalar outputs**, and shows how upstream gradients control the flow of sensitivity through the computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on developing conceptual intuition for:\n",
    "- how gradients are defined for tensor-valued outputs,\n",
    "- how explicit upstream gradients interact with the computation graph,\n",
    "- how gradients propagate back to leaf tensors,\n",
    "- and how PyTorch accumulates and manages gradients across backward passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics covered include:\n",
    "- the distinction between scalar losses and tensor-valued outputs,\n",
    "- how PyTorch computes vector–Jacobian products via `backward(v)`,\n",
    "- the role of upstream gradients in shaping `inp.grad`,\n",
    "- gradient accumulation and the need to explicitly zero gradients,\n",
    "- and practical interpretation of gradient structure through visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended as a conceptual bridge between:\n",
    "- basic autograd usage with scalar losses (Tutorial 2),\n",
    "- and more advanced topics such as full Jacobians, Jacobian–vector products, and sensitivity analysis (Tutorial 5 and beyond).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not cover neural network modules, optimisers, or training pipelines. The focus is strictly on autograd mechanics and gradient interpretation, independent of model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended prerequisites:\n",
    "- Familiarity with PyTorch tensors and basic operations\n",
    "- Understanding of scalar backpropagation and `.backward()`\n",
    "- Basic comfort with gradients and partial derivatives\n",

    "### From scalar losses to tensor-valued outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In most machine learning workflows, we work with a scalar loss function and compute gradients with respect to model parameters.\n",
    "This scalar setting allows PyTorch to apply backpropagation automatically, storing gradients directly in `.grad`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all computations naturally end in a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical and analytical settings, the output of interest is an arbitrary **tensor** rather than a single number. In such cases, a full gradient is no longer *well-defined* in the usual sense. Instead, the derivative of a tensor-valued function is a **Jacobian matrix**, which can be large and expensive to construct explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than forming this Jacobian, PyTorch computes Jacobian products efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, PyTorch evaluates **vector–Jacobian products** (VJPs), which answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How does a weighted combination of the output change with respect to earlier tensors?"

    "#### First Line\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.eye()\n",
    "```\n",
    "creates a identity-like matrix (ones on the diagonal, zeros elsewhere). \n",
    "\n",
    "By passing `requires_grad=True`, we tell PyTorch to track all subsequent operations on this tensor so that gradients can be computed during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `out` is now a **tensor-valued output**, not a scalar:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "out = (inp+1).pow(2).t()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line performs several operations in sequence:\n",
    "1. `inp + 1` adds 1 element-wise to the input tensor.\n",
    "2. `.pow(2)` squares each element, introducing a nonlinear operation (common in machine learning models).\n",
    "3. `.t()` transposes the matrix, changing its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, out is a matrix, not a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third Line: why does `backward()` need an argument here?\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier tutorials, we always called backward() on a scalar loss. In that case, PyTorch *implicitly* assumes an upstream gradient of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, however, out is not a scalar. Calling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "out.backward()\n",
    "```\n",
    "would raise an error, because PyTorch does not know which **combination of gradients** you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we must explicitly provide an upstream gradient with the **same shape** as `out`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "out.backward(torch.ones_like(out), retain_graph=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells PyTorch:\n",
    "> “Compute the vector–Jacobian product where the upstream gradient is a tensor of ones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final line: What is `inp.grad` showing us?\n",
    "After calling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "out.backward(torch.ones_like(out), retain_graph=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "PyTorch computes gradients **with respect to all leaf tensors** that have `requires_grad=True`.\n",
    "In this example, the only such tensor is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inp\n",
    "```\n",
    "As a result, PyTorch stores the gradient of the output `out` with respect to `inp` in:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inp.grad\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wait a second...\n",
    "This could be counter-intuitive for beginners, as the `backward()` is called on `out`, but the gradient is stored on `inp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the key mental shift is:\n",
    "> `backward()` is not asking “what is the gradient of this tensor?”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is asking “how did this output depend on earlier tensors?”\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, when you call:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "out.backward(torch.ones_like(out))\n",
    "```\n",
    "you are telling PyTorch:\n",
    "> “Assume out represents the end of a computation.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Please compute how changes in earlier tensors would affect it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, PyTorch computes:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\text{leaf tensors})}\n",
    "\\Big(v_{\\text{upstream}}^{\\top}\\cdot\\text{out}\\Big)$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $v_{\\text{upstream}}$ is the upstream gradient supplied to `backward()` (in our case, `torch.ones_like(out)`, which corresponds to summing all entries of out with **equal weight**; other choices are also valid).\n",
    "- The expression $v_{\\text{upstream}}^{\\top}\\cdot\\text{out}$ is equivalent to $\\sum_i v_{\\text{upstream},i}\\,\\text{out}_i$, giving a scalar as the result. This is called **gradient produced via a vector–Jacobian product (VJP)**.\n",
    "- Only the leaf tensors (see definition in Tutorial 2) accumulate gradients in their `.grad` attribute during backpropagation (in our case, `inp` is the (only) leaf tensor, and hence PyTorch stores the result of the above derivative in `inp.grad`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that mathematically, the gradient (partial derivatives) of a scalar $L$ with respect to a matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial X}\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) two reasons why PyTorch does not store the gradient in `out`:\n",
    "1. **`out` is not a parameter.** We don’t usually update out; we update inputs like weights.\n",
    "2. **Gradients are defined with respect to inputs.** The whole purpose of backpropagation is to answer: “Which earlier values should I change to reduce the output?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "The need to pass an argument to `backward()` here is not because we want to call `backward()` multiple times. It is because `out` is non-scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we pass `retain_graph=True` is separate:\n",
    "- it allows the same computation graph to be reused in later cells,\n",
    "- which is useful for demonstration and debugging.\n",
