    "# 🧪 Workshop 1: From Gradient Flow to Optimisation Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop builds on Tutorials 1–4 and closes **Part 1** of the series, consolidating core ideas about PyTorch `autograd` and gradient flow before moving on to explicit optimisation in Workshop 2 and Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating gradients as black-box training signals, the workshop emphasises **gradients as sensitivity measures**, especially in settings where model outputs are **tensor-valued** and gradients are computed using **explicit upstream directions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems are designed to shift perspective:\n",
    "- from *“what gradient does PyTorch give me?”*\n",
    "- to *“what does this gradient represent, and why?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on developing intuition for:\n",
    "- how gradients flow through structured linear and nonlinear computations,\n",
    "- how upstream gradients select directions in output space,\n",
    "- how `.grad` reflects sensitivity rather than optimisation,\n",
    "- and how gradient structure anticipates optimisation behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas explored include:\n",
    "- vector–Jacobian products as the fundamental object computed by `backward(v)`,\n",
    "- the role of upstream gradients in shaping gradient flow,\n",
    "- sparsity and structure in gradients induced by linear maps and nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU),\n",
    "- interpreting gradients statistically and geometrically rather than procedurally,\n",
    "- and using controlled experiments to reason about gradient behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop serves as a conceptual bridge between:\n",
    "- `autograd` mechanics and gradient flow (Tutorials 3–4),\n",
    "- and **objective design and optimisation dynamics** (Workshop 2 and Part 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is intentionally *not* on training pipelines, datasets, or optimisers, but on understanding how gradients behave in controlled settings—laying the groundwork for effective optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended prerequisites:\n",
    "- Familiarity with PyTorch tensors and `.backward()`\n",
    "- Understanding of scalar vs tensor-valued gradients\n",
    "- Basic comfort with linear algebra and nonlinear activations\n",

    ">In many models, inputs are transformed into feature representations before being used by a downstream objective.\n",
    "> Understanding which inputs influence which features is critical for interpretability and optimisation.\n",

    "1.\tConstruct an upstream gradient vector `v` such that:\n",

    "    - the first two features are ignored.\n",
    "2. Call:\n",

    "out.backward(v)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Inspect `x.grad`.\n",

    "### 🧠 Questions to think about\n",
    "- Which components of `x` receive non-zero gradients?\n",
    "- How does the structure of `W` affect gradient flow?\n",
    "- How does ReLU change which inputs are “active”?\n",
    "- Why is `x.grad` sparse in some cases?\n",

    "### 💡 Hint (optional)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After this problem, you should be comfortable with:\n",

    "- reasoning about gradient flow through linear + nonlinear layers,\n",
