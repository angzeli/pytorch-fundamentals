    "# Scope of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces a **minimal learning problem** in PyTorch, focusing on how gradient-based learning works at a mechanical level.  \n",
    "It demonstrates how model parameters are updated through repeated application of forward computation, loss evaluation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on developing **clear intuition** for:\n",
    "- how losses are defined and computed,\n",
    "- how gradients are obtained using PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine,\n",
    "- how parameter updates lead to learning over multiple iterations,\n",
    "- and how the learning rate affects convergence behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "All concepts are illustrated using explicit tensor operations and a fully manual training loop, without relying on higher-level abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended as a **conceptual bridge** between basic tensor operations and more advanced PyTorch workflows.  \n",
    "Readers should finish this notebook with a solid understanding of *what learning means computationally*, before introducing optimisers or neural network modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does **not** introduce `nn.Module`, built-in optimisers, datasets, or data loaders.  \n",
    "These abstractions will be introduced in subsequent notebooks once the underlying mechanics are well understood.\n",

    "**Recommended prerequisites:** Familiarity with PyTorch tensor fundamentals, basic Python programming, and elementary linear algebra.\n",
